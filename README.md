This project is not being actively developed. The code has been
acquired by and incorporated to

Intelligent decisions in real time
----------------------------------

Into is a cross-platform real-time data processing framework written
in C++. It provides a different, super-fast way to build cutting-edge,
high-performance applications for image analysis, machine vision,
pattern recognition and artificial intelligence.

Wide selection of tools
-----------------------

Into features a layered API and more than 20 fully interoperable
plug-in modules for accessing image and data sources, powerful feature
extractors, classifiers, neural networks, and much more.

So much more than an API
------------------------

Into is much more than a typical software library or API. It features
an innovative execution engine, Ydin, that makes it easy to create
dynamic programs that automatically run in parallel.

Create with speed and ease
--------------------------

Into lets you create complex, distributed applications with
unprecedented ease and speed. Close intergration with Qt/QML and a
JavaScript API makes creating applications with beautiful user
interfaces a snap.

And yes, it's free
------------------

Into is free software, licensed under the Affero GPL v3. A special
exception makes it compatible with the most common open source
licenses. If you don't want to release your sources under an open
